# node-js-getting-started

Node.js app using WebSockets and three.js to create a multiplayer action game. 

The seed numbers used to generate the terrain are generated by the server and shared with each client. The client generates a raster image that is converted into geometry for display.

This application was started with the Getting Started with Node on Heroku article.

Includes code from https://github.com/josdirksen/threejs-cookbook/blob/master/02-geometries-meshes/02.06-create-terrain-from-heightmap.html
